{"id":"ssage-2wm","title":"Case Study Content Gaps — Problem Statement \u0026 Data Request","description":"Several comments from document review (Feb 2026) identify missing or weak content in the Metro Cable case study sections, particularly around problem statement development and data requests.\n\n## 1. Word Cloud — Replace with Table (Comment [115] — Deniz Oker)\n**Location:** Lesson containing the word cloud visualization\nThe current word cloud is described as 'very confusing and disorganized.' Replace with a table or structured alternative that presents the same information more clearly.\n\n## 2. Problem Statement — Show 7-Element Evaluation First (Comment [121] — Deniz Oker)\n**Location:** Metro Cable problem statement section\nThe Metro Cable case study jumps straight to the boiled-down problem statement. The initial problem statement was actually derived from evaluation across the 7 elements (as shown in slide 12 of the PPT). Add slide 12's content/visual before the final problem statement to show the step-by-step thinking process.\n\n## 3. Problem Statement Refinement Process Flow (Comment [122] — Deniz Oker)\n**Location:** Section introducing iterative problem statement refinement\nAdd a process flow showing how an initial problem statement is iteratively refined until reaching the final list of ops. This should visualize the iterative refinement steps.\n\n## 4. Data Request — Add Risks \u0026 Considerations (Comment [131] — Deniz Oker)\n**Location:** 05-data-request-and-ingestion.mdx — 'The Formal Data Request' section\nAdd risks and considerations for data requests, sourced from slide 19 of the playbook PPT.\n\n## 5. Metro Cable Data Request — Add Example List (Comment [132] — Deniz Oker)\n**Location:** 05-data-request-and-ingestion.mdx — 'Metro Cable Example – Initial Data Request' section\nAdd a concrete example data request list for the Metro Cable case study, sourced from slide 18 of the PPT. Currently this section lacks an actual example.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"mderganc@ssaandco.com","created_at":"2026-02-24T11:15:27.279273841-06:00","created_by":"Matt Derganc","updated_at":"2026-02-24T11:18:53.994306224-06:00","external_ref":"gh-43","labels":["case-study","content"]}
{"id":"ssage-qnk","title":"Pull PPT Graphics into Course Lessons","description":"Multiple comments from document review (Feb 2026) request that graphics from the PowerPoint deck be integrated into corresponding course lessons. All slides referenced are from the AOMT Playbook PPT.\n\n## Graphics to Add\n\n### Slide 5 → 04-introducing-aomt.mdx (Comments [93] Deniz, [94] Paul)\nAdd the concept graphic from slide 5 of the playbook PPT to the 'Introducing AI Enabled Problem-Solving' lesson. Paul noted 'this or something better' is acceptable.\n\n### Slide 6 → 05-playbook-structure.mdx (Comments [102] Deniz, [103] Paul)\nReplace the current bullet-point list in the Playbook Structure lesson with the visual from slide 6. Both reviewers agreed the visual is cleaner and more effective.\n\n### Slide 10 → Core Activities process flow (Comment [112] Deniz)\nThe current process flow looks linear/waterfall. Replace with the circular/iterative graphic from slide 10, which better represents the non-linear nature of the methodology.\n\n### Slide 11 → 03-problem-statement.mdx (Comment [119] Deniz)\nReplace the bullet list of Problem Statement elements (Timeframe, etc.) with the visual graphic from slide 11.\n\n### Slide 15 → Issue Tree section (Comment [125] Deniz)\nAdd an example issue tree for the Metro Cable case study, sourced from slide 15 of the PPT. The current section references an issue tree but shows no visual example.\n\n## Action Required\nExport or adapt the relevant slides from the PowerPoint deck and integrate as images or structured components in the MDX lessons.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"mderganc@ssaandco.com","created_at":"2026-02-24T11:15:08.692592596-06:00","created_by":"Matt Derganc","updated_at":"2026-02-24T11:18:48.045058068-06:00","external_ref":"gh-42","labels":["content","design"]}
{"id":"ssage-teb","title":"Navigation \u0026 Progress Indicators","description":"Two structural UX improvements identified during document review (Feb 2026).\n\n## 1. Breadcrumb / Progress Indicator (Comment [117] — Deniz Oker)\n**Location:** All section/lesson pages\nIt is not clear to the reader which stage/activity they are currently on. Add a breadcrumb or visual progress clue that shows location within sections, chapters, topics, and steps on every page.\nExample mockup was referenced but not attached — coordinate with design for implementation.\n\n## 2. Simplify Summary TOC Entry (Comment [26] — Paul Giessler)\n**Location:** Table of Contents / course navigation\nThe Playbook Summary section spans only part of one page. The sub-section breakdown in the TOC is unnecessary at that scale — collapse it to a single 'Summary' item rather than listing sub-sections.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"mderganc@ssaandco.com","created_at":"2026-02-24T11:14:50.249097712-06:00","created_by":"Matt Derganc","updated_at":"2026-02-24T11:18:42.162425946-06:00","external_ref":"gh-41","labels":["content","ux"]}
