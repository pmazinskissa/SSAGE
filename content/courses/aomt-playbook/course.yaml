  This course follows the Metro Cable case study — a fictional telecommunications company facing operational challenges. Through this running example, you'll see every concept applied to real-world scenarios: diagnosing customer service problems with AI-powered data analysis, prioritizing improvement opportunities using WSJF scoring, prototyping AI-powered solutions, and sustaining improvements through structured governance.

  The playbook covers three main sections: a Practitioners Guide for AI-empowered problem solving and tool development, a Sustainment Framework for maintaining improvements, and an Organizational Change Management approach for driving adoption.
