  - term: "AOMT"
    definition: "Agentic Operating Model Transformation. A three-phase methodology for diagnosing operational problems, prioritizing solutions, and sustaining improvements using agile governance. Rests on two foundational principles: Data First and AI First."
    first_lesson: "04-introducing-aomt"

  - term: "Data First"
    definition: "The principle of ingesting and interrogating comprehensive data before proposing solutions. Instead of starting with stakeholder impressions, start with data patterns and validate them against stakeholder experience."
    first_lesson: "04-introducing-aomt"

  - term: "AI First"
    definition: "The principle of designing solutions that take full advantage of AI capabilities to achieve quantum gains in efficiency. Ask 'what becomes possible if AI handles this?' rather than 'how can AI speed up step 3?'"
    first_lesson: "04-introducing-aomt"

  - term: "Problem Statement"
    definition: "Structured format defining the problem being solved. Contains seven components: Description, Customers, Decision Makers, Decision Drivers, Boundaries, Success Measures, and Timeframe."
    first_lesson: "03-problem-statement"

  - term: "Issues Tree"
    definition: "A structured MECE decomposition tool that breaks a problem into logical component parts. Depicted horizontally with trunk (main problem), branches, sub-branches, and twigs."
    first_lesson: "04-issues-tree-and-hypotheses"

  - term: "System of Record"
    definition: "The authoritative source for a given dataset. When multiple systems store the same data, the system of record is the agreed-upon single source of truth used in analysis. Establishing this agreement early prevents rework when presenting findings to stakeholders."
    first_lesson: "05-data-request-and-ingestion"

  - term: "Hypothesis Testing"
    definition: "Scientific method applied to operational problems using Null Hypothesis (H0: no effect) and Alternative Hypothesis (Ha: no effect cannot be proven). Rejecting H0 means the factor warrants investigation, not that causation is proven."
    first_lesson: "04-issues-tree-and-hypotheses"

  - term: "Validated Gap"
    definition: "The measured difference between current performance and a benchmark, confirmed by both quantitative data and qualitative interviews. A gap in data but not interviews (or vice versa) is a hypothesis, not validated."
    first_lesson: "08-analysis-validation"

  - term: "Baseline"
    definition: "The pre-implementation measurement used as a reference point. Must be specific, measured, and documented before any solution is implemented."
    first_lesson: "08-analysis-validation"

  - term: "Benchmark"
    definition: "An external or industry-standard reference point used to assess whether a gap is significant. Answers the question 'compared to what?'"
    first_lesson: "09-ai-enabled-research"

  - term: "Root Cause vs. Symptom"
    definition: "A root cause is the mechanism producing the observed problem. A symptom is the problem itself. Phase 1 requires root causes, not symptoms."
    first_lesson: "08-analysis-validation"

  - term: "Drift"
    definition: "Gradual, unintended regression of a metric toward its pre-implementation baseline. Dangerous because it is gradual and compounds over time."
    first_lesson: "01-sustainment-framework"

  - term: "WSJF"
    definition: "Weighted Shortest Job First. Phase 2 scoring method: Cost of Delay / Job Size = WSJF Score. Cost of Delay = Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction & Opportunity Enablement."
    first_lesson: "02-wsjf-scoring-method"

  - term: "Business Value"
    definition: "A 1-10 rating of the business value that an option delivers. Scored by the cross-functional team. Common error: confusing effort required with value delivered."
    first_lesson: "02-wsjf-scoring-method"

  - term: "Time Criticality"
    definition: "A 1-10 rating of urgency. Higher scores indicate regulatory deadlines, competitive pressure, or customer attrition risk."
    first_lesson: "02-wsjf-scoring-method"

  - term: "Risk Reduction & Opportunity Enablement"
    definition: "A 1-10 rating of organizational risk mitigated or future capabilities unlocked by implementing the option."
    first_lesson: "02-wsjf-scoring-method"

  - term: "Job Size"
    definition: "A 1-10 rating of implementation duration and complexity. The divisor in WSJF, so high-effort options need proportionally higher value to justify ranking."
    first_lesson: "02-wsjf-scoring-method"

  - term: "Fibonacci"
    definition: "A numerical sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13…) where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, named for Leonardo of Pisa whose 1202 book Liber Abaci popularized it. Used in WSJF scoring as 'Fibonacci-like values' because the increasing gaps between numbers force relative trade-off judgments rather than false precision."
    first_lesson: "02-wsjf-scoring-method"

  - term: "Context + Task + Output"
    definition: "The prompt structure used throughout AOMT for AI interactions. Context provides validated findings, Task specifies what AI should produce, Output defines the format."
    first_lesson: "07-curiosity-enabled-analysis"

  - term: "Sequential Prompting"
    definition: "Breaking a complex ask into multiple turns rather than one prompt. Each turn lets the practitioner check output before it becomes input for the next step."
    first_lesson: "10-data-analysis-plan"

  - term: "Hallucination"
    definition: "When an AI model generates factually wrong but structurally plausible text. LLMs produce statistically likely text, not verified facts. AOMT treats all AI-generated figures as unverified until checked."
    first_lesson: "08-analysis-validation"

  - term: "Sensitivity Analysis"
