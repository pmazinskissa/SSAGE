# Guiding Principles

This playbook is designed to be **generic and agnostic** to any specific tools, processes, or organizational structures. Always align with your organizational policies and governance frameworks.

## Core Design Principles

<Callout type="concept" title="Broad Application">
Principles apply across industries, company sizes, and business contexts. These methods work whether you're executing improvements within a telecommunications company or a financial services firm.
</Callout>

<Callout type="concept" title="High-Level Methods">
The playbook is guidance-driven without prioritizing any specific improvement methodology over another. It provides exemplary approaches and techniques that can be adapted to your organization's existing practices and maturity level.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Illustrative Examples">
Mock data and scenarios demonstrate concepts without real data exposure. The Metro Cable case study brings every concept to life through practical application.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Policy Compliant">
Always defer to your organizational data and AI governance policies. This playbook provides a framework — your organization provides the guardrails.
</Callout>
