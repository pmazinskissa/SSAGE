# Guiding Principles

This playbook is designed to be **generic and agnostic** to any specific tools, processes, or organizational structures. Always align with your organizational policies and governance frameworks.

## Foundational Principles

The AI-Enabled Problem Solving methodology rests on two foundational principles that guide every phase of transformation:

<Callout type="concept" title="Data First">
Always start with data before forming conclusions. Ingest broadly, analyze deeply, and let patterns emerge from evidence rather than assumptions. Data First means grounding every decision in evidence — not opinions, not hunches, not "the way we've always done it."
</Callout>

<Callout type="concept" title="AI First">
Design solutions that leverage the full capabilities of AI. Rather than asking "how can AI speed up one step?", ask "what becomes possible if AI handles this?" AI First means treating AI as the primary analytical and decision-support tool, not an afterthought.
</Callout>

## Core Design Principles

<Callout type="concept" title="Broad Application">
Principles apply across industries, company sizes, and transformation contexts. The methodology works whether you're transforming a telecommunications company or a financial services firm.
</Callout>

<Callout type="concept" title="High-Level Methods">
The playbook is guidance-driven without prioritizing any specific methodology over another. It provides exemplary approaches and techniques that can be adapted to your organization's existing practices and maturity level.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Illustrative Examples">
Mock data and scenarios demonstrate concepts without real data exposure. The Metro Cable case study brings every concept to life through practical application.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Policy Compliant">
Always defer to your organizational data and AI governance policies. This playbook provides a framework — your organization provides the guardrails.
</Callout>
