# Introducing AI-Enabled Problem Solving

**AI-Enabled Problem Solving** is a non-linear approach to operational transformations that leverages Artificial Intelligence and emerging technologies to move much farther and faster in achieving an organization's objectives.

## Two Core Principles

<Callout type="concept" title="Data First">
Ingest and interrogate the data landscape to reveal and verify evidence-based opportunities. Instead of starting with stakeholder impressions, start with data patterns and validate them against stakeholder experience.
</Callout>

<Callout type="concept" title="AI First">
Design solutions that take full advantage of AI capabilities to make quantum gains in efficiency. Ask "what becomes possible if AI handles this?" rather than "how can AI speed up step 3?"
</Callout>

## Core Activities

<Callout type="concept" title="Key Principle">
Activities are iterative and frequently done concurrently to quickly yield "best fit" solutions. This is not a waterfall process — it thrives on parallel execution and continuous feedback.
