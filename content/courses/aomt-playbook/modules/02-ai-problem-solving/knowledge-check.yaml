  - id: "m2-q1"
    type: "multiple-choice-single"
    question: "Which of the following is a proper Problem Statement rather than a solution statement?"
    options:
      - id: "a"
        text: "We need to implement a new CRM system"
      - id: "b"
        text: "Customer wait times exceed industry benchmarks by 40%, driving churn"
      - id: "c"
        text: "We should hire more customer service representatives"
      - id: "d"
        text: "The IT department needs to upgrade their servers"
    correct_option: "b"
    explanation: "A problem statement describes the observable gap between current state and desired state without prescribing a solution. Option B quantifies the gap and its impact."

  - id: "m2-q2"
    type: "multiple-choice-multi"
    question: "Which of the following are elements of a well-crafted Problem Statement? (Select all that apply)"
    options:
      - id: "a"
        text: "Description of the problem"
      - id: "b"
        text: "Proposed solution"
      - id: "c"
        text: "Success Measures"
      - id: "d"
        text: "Decision Makers"
      - id: "e"
        text: "Implementation timeline"
    correct_options:
      - "a"
      - "c"
      - "d"
    explanation: "The 7 elements of a Problem Statement are: Description, Customers, Decision Makers, Decision Drivers, Boundaries, Success Measures, and Timeframe. 'Proposed solution' and 'Implementation timeline' are not part of the framework."

    type: "matching"
    question: "Match each prompt framework component with its description:"
    pairs:
      - id: "context"
        left: "Context"
        right: "Background information and relevant data"
      - id: "task"
        left: "Task"
        right: "Specific analytical action to perform"
      - id: "output"
        left: "Output"
        right: "Desired format and detail level of results"
    explanation: "The Context + Task + Output framework structures AI analysis prompts: Context provides background, Task defines the specific action, and Output specifies the desired format."

  - id: "m2-q4"
    type: "true-false"
    question: "In the AOMT methodology, you should pre-plan your entire analysis sequence before beginning any data exploration."
    correct_answer: false
    explanation: "False. The AOMT approach recommends starting with a broad question, interpreting the results, and letting curiosity guide the next question. AI makes this exploratory, non-linear approach optimal."
