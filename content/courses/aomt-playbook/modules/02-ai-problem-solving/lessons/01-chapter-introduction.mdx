# AI-Empowered Problem Solving

This chapter introduces the core diagnostic and prioritization methodology that sets AI-Enabled Problem Solving apart from traditional consulting approaches. Rather than relying on stakeholder interviews and assumptions, this approach starts with data and uses AI to accelerate every stage of analysis.

<Callout type="concept" title="Two-Phase Approach">
AI-Empowered Problem Solving operates in two distinct phases. Phase 1 focuses on iterative diagnosis — ingesting data, surfacing patterns, and synthesizing findings. Phase 2 focuses on prioritizing the opportunities uncovered during diagnosis into an actionable roadmap.
</Callout>



## Phase 1: Iterative Diagnosis

<CircularActivityFlow />

Phase 1 follows a structured but non-linear process built around three core activities:

<ProcessFlow steps={[
  { title: "Data Ingestion", description: "Connect to data sources, load structured and unstructured data into AI tools, and establish a working data environment" },
  { title: "AI-Assisted Diagnosis", description: "Use AI to decompose problems, generate hypotheses, run analyses, and validate findings against benchmarks" },
  { title: "Synthesis", description: "Convert validated findings into clearly articulated opportunities with supporting evidence and quantified impact" }
]} />

Each activity feeds back into the others. A finding from diagnosis may trigger a new data request, and synthesis may reveal gaps that require additional analysis cycles.

## Phase 2: Prioritization

Once opportunities are identified and documented, Phase 2 applies structured scoring methods to rank them by value, complexity, and strategic alignment. This transforms a list of possibilities into a sequenced roadmap that stakeholders can review and act on.

<Callout type="tip" title="Why This Matters">
Traditional problem-solving can take weeks of interviews and workshops before a single insight emerges. With AI-empowered diagnosis, practitioners can surface data-driven insights within hours, then validate those insights with stakeholders — dramatically accelerating time to action.

The lessons that follow walk through each part of this process in detail, with practical examples based on a fictional case study involving Metro Cable.
