# Diagnosis Overview

The diagnostic process is a cycle of 6 core activities. Unlike traditional linear methodologies, these activities are revisited as new data emerges and hypotheses are tested. Each iteration refines the understanding of the problem and moves practitioners closer to actionable, evidence-based opportunities.

## The 6 Core Activities



## Iterative by Design

<Callout type="concept" title="Non-Linear Execution">
Activities are not completed once and abandoned. As analysis reveals new patterns, you will return to earlier activities — refining the problem statement, adding branches to the issues tree, or requesting additional data. Each pass deepens diagnostic accuracy.
</Callout>

## How AI Accelerates Each Activity

| Activity | Traditional Approach | AI-Enabled Approach |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Problem Statement | Weeks of stakeholder interviews | Data-informed scoping in hours |
| Issues Tree | Workshop-based brainstorming | AI-generated MECE decomposition with human refinement |
| Data Request | Manual inventory of available data | AI-assisted data landscape mapping |
| Hypotheses | Experience-based assumptions | Data-pattern-driven hypothesis generation |
| Analysis Plan | Senior consultant design | AI-suggested analytical approaches |
| Analysis & Synthesis | Manual spreadsheet analysis | AI-powered pattern recognition and visualization |

<Callout type="tip" title="Speed Advantage">
A traditional diagnostic cycle might take 4-6 weeks. With AI assistance, practitioners can complete multiple diagnostic iterations in the same timeframe, producing more robust and data-grounded findings.
