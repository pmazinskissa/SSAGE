# Diagnosis Overview

The AOMT diagnostic process is a 6-step iterative cycle. Unlike traditional linear methodologies, these steps are revisited as new data emerges and hypotheses are tested. Each iteration refines the understanding of the problem space and moves closer to actionable, evidence-based opportunities.

## The 6-Step Iterative Process

<ProcessFlow steps={[
  { title: "1. Problem Statement", description: "Define the scope, stakeholders, boundaries, and success measures for the engagement" },
  { title: "2. Issues Tree", description: "Decompose the problem into MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) sub-issues for systematic investigation" },
  { title: "3. Data Request", description: "Identify and formally request the specific datasets needed to test each branch of the issues tree" },
  { title: "4. Hypotheses", description: "Formulate testable null and alternative hypotheses for each issue, grounded in data rather than assumptions" },
  { title: "5. Analysis Plan", description: "Define the analytical methods, tools, and sequence for testing each hypothesis" },
  { title: "6. Analysis & Synthesis", description: "Execute analyses, validate findings, and synthesize results into documented opportunities" }
]} />

## Iterative by Design

<Callout type="concept" title="Non-Linear Execution">
Steps are not completed once and abandoned. As analysis reveals new patterns, you will return to earlier steps — refining the problem statement, adding branches to the issues tree, or requesting additional data. Each pass deepens diagnostic accuracy.

## How AI Accelerates Each Step

| Step | Traditional Approach | AI-Enabled Approach |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Problem Statement | Weeks of stakeholder interviews | Data-informed scoping in hours |
| Issues Tree | Workshop-based brainstorming | AI-generated MECE decomposition with human refinement |
| Data Request | Manual inventory of available data | AI-assisted data landscape mapping |
| Hypotheses | Experience-based assumptions | Data-pattern-driven hypothesis generation |
| Analysis Plan | Senior consultant design | AI-suggested analytical approaches |
| Analysis & Synthesis | Manual spreadsheet analysis | AI-powered pattern recognition and visualization |

<Callout type="tip" title="Speed Advantage">
A traditional diagnostic cycle might take 4-6 weeks. With AI assistance, practitioners can complete multiple diagnostic iterations in the same timeframe, producing more robust and data-grounded findings.
