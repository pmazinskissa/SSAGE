# Problem Statement

A well-crafted <GlossaryTerm term="Problem Statement">Problem Statement</GlossaryTerm> is the foundation of every engagement. It establishes the boundaries of investigation, aligns stakeholders on scope, and provides the criteria against which all findings and recommendations will be measured.

## The 7 Elements

<ProblemStatementElements />

Every Problem Statement should address these seven elements:



<Callout type="concept" title="Key Principle: The Problem Statement Is a Living Document">
The Problem Statement is drafted at the start of the engagement but refined throughout the diagnostic process. As data reveals unexpected patterns or stakeholders provide new context, the Problem Statement should be updated to reflect the evolving understanding.

## Crafting the Problem Statement with AI

AI can accelerate Problem Statement development by analyzing initial data to suggest scope boundaries and surface potential success measures. However, the practitioner must validate AI suggestions against stakeholder context and organizational realities.

<Callout type="warning" title="Avoid Solution Bias">
A Problem Statement should never prescribe a solution. "We need to implement a chatbot" is a solution statement. "Customer wait times exceed industry benchmarks by 40%, driving churn" is a problem statement. Let the data guide you to solutions.
</Callout>

<ReflectionPrompt
  question="Think about a current challenge in your organization. Can you frame it as a Problem Statement using the 7 elements? What would be the 'Description' and 'Success Measures' for your problem?"
  answer="A strong Problem Statement separates the problem from the solution. For example: 'Customer onboarding takes an average of 14 days versus a target of 5 days, resulting in 23% of new customers abandoning the process.' The Description quantifies the gap; the Success Measures would be 'Reduce average onboarding time to 5 days while maintaining quality scores above 4.2/5.'"
