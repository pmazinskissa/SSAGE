# Problem Statement

A well-crafted <GlossaryTerm term="Problem Statement">Problem Statement</GlossaryTerm> is the foundation of every engagement. It establishes the boundaries of investigation, aligns stakeholders on scope, and provides the criteria against which all findings and recommendations will be measured.

## The 7 Elements

Every Problem Statement should address these seven elements:

1. **Description** — A clear, concise articulation of the problem or opportunity being investigated. Avoid solution language; focus on the observable gap between current state and desired state.

2. **Customers** — Who is affected by this problem? Identify both internal customers (teams, departments) and external customers (end users, clients) impacted by the current state.

3. **Decision Makers** — Who has the authority to approve recommendations and allocate resources? Identify the specific individuals, not just roles.

4. **Decision Drivers** — What factors will influence how decisions are made? Consider financial thresholds, strategic priorities, regulatory constraints, and organizational risk appetite.

5. **Boundaries** — What is explicitly in scope and out of scope? Clear boundaries prevent scope creep and keep analysis focused.

6. **Success Measures** — How will you know the problem is solved? Define quantifiable metrics (e.g., "reduce average handling time by 15%") rather than vague goals.

7. **Timeframe** — What is the deadline for delivering findings and recommendations? Include interim milestones for iterative check-ins. Note: this is the *diagnostic* timeframe, not an implementation timeline — solution timelines come later, after recommendations are accepted.

<Callout type="concept" title="Key Principle: The Problem Statement Is a Living Document">
The Problem Statement is drafted at the start of the engagement but refined throughout the diagnostic process. As data reveals unexpected patterns or stakeholders provide new context, the Problem Statement should be updated to reflect the evolving understanding. Treat it as version-controlled, not carved in stone.

## Crafting the Problem Statement with AI

AI can accelerate Problem Statement development by analyzing initial data to suggest scope boundaries and surface potential success measures. However, the practitioner must validate AI suggestions against stakeholder context and organizational realities.

<Callout type="warning" title="Avoid Solution Bias">
A Problem Statement should never prescribe a solution. "We need to implement a chatbot" is a solution statement. "Customer wait times exceed industry benchmarks by 40%, driving churn" is a problem statement. Let the data guide you to solutions.

<ReflectionPrompt
  question="Think about a current challenge in your organization. Can you frame it as a Problem Statement using the 7 elements? What would be the 'Description' and 'Success Measures' for your problem?"
  answer="A strong Problem Statement separates the problem from the solution. For example: 'Customer onboarding takes an average of 14 days versus a target of 5 days, resulting in 23% of new customers abandoning the process.' The Description quantifies the gap; the Success Measures would be 'Reduce average onboarding time to 5 days while maintaining quality scores above 4.2/5.'"

## Metro Cable Example

In the Metro Cable case study, the Problem Statement centered on operational inefficiency in field service dispatch. The description identified a gap between current dispatch accuracy (62%) and the industry benchmark (85%), with customers defined as both field technicians and end subscribers awaiting service.
