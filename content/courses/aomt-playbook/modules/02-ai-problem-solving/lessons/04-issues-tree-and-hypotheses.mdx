# Issues Tree & Hypotheses

An <GlossaryTerm term="Issues Tree">Issues Tree</GlossaryTerm> decomposes a complex problem into mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive (MECE) sub-issues. Each branch of the tree becomes a testable area of investigation, and each sub-issue generates one or more hypotheses to be validated through data analysis.

## MECE Decomposition

The MECE principle ensures that:
- **Mutually Exclusive** — No overlap between branches. Each data point maps to exactly one branch.
- **Collectively Exhaustive** — All possible causes or factors are covered. No blind spots remain.

AI is particularly effective at generating initial MECE decompositions. Provide the AI with the Problem Statement and ask it to decompose the problem into 4-6 top-level branches, then 2-4 sub-branches beneath each. The practitioner then reviews, refines, and validates the structure.

<PromptExample
  prompt="Our problem statement is: 'Metro Cable's first-visit resolution rate has declined from 78% to 62% over the past 12 months, increasing repeat dispatches and customer dissatisfaction.' Decompose this into a MECE Issues Tree with 4-5 top-level branches and 2-3 sub-issues under each. For every sub-issue, suggest a testable hypothesis."
  response="Here is a MECE Issues Tree for Metro Cable's declining first-visit resolution rate:

1. **Dispatch & Routing Efficiency**
   - Geographic mismatch between technician location and job site (H1: Avg. travel distance increased >20%, reducing available on-site time)
   - Skill-to-job-type misalignment in dispatch assignments (H1: Jobs assigned outside a technician's top certification area have 30%+ lower resolution rates)

2. **Technician Capability**
   - Declining training completion rates for new equipment types (H1: Technicians without updated certifications resolve new-equipment jobs at <50% on first visit)
   - Experience distribution shift due to workforce turnover (H1: Technicians with <1 year tenure have first-visit resolution rates 25%+ below veterans)

3. **Parts & Equipment Availability**
   - Truck stock-out rates for commonly needed parts (H1: >15% of return visits are caused by parts not carried on the initial truck)
   - Inventory forecasting misaligned with seasonal job-type mix (H1: Stock-out rates spike in Q1 and Q3, correlating with resolution rate dips)

4. **Job Complexity & Scope Changes**
   - Increase in multi-issue service calls being logged as single jobs (H1: Jobs with 2+ issue codes have doubled in the past 12 months)
   - New service offerings added without updated resolution criteria (H1: Resolution rate for services launched in the past year is <55%)

5. **Customer & Scheduling Factors**
   - Narrower appointment windows reducing technician flexibility (H1: Jobs with <2-hour windows have 20%+ lower resolution rates)
   - Incomplete pre-visit information from customer intake (H1: Jobs with missing equipment model or symptom details require return visits at 2x the base rate)"

<Callout type="tip" title="Review Before You Trust">
AI-generated decompositions are a starting point. Check each branch for genuine mutual exclusivity — is there overlap between "Dispatch Efficiency" and "Technician Capability"? Validate with domain experts to catch blind spots the AI may miss.
</Callout>

## Hypothesis Framework

For each branch of the Issues Tree, formulate a Null Hypothesis (H0) and an Alternative Hypothesis (H1):

- **H0 (Null Hypothesis):** The default assumption that no significant relationship or difference exists. Example: "Dispatch routing method has no statistically significant effect on first-visit resolution rate."
- **H1 (Alternative Hypothesis):** The assertion that a meaningful relationship or difference does exist. Example: "AI-optimized dispatch routing improves first-visit resolution rate by at least 10 percentage points."

<BeforeAfter
  before="We think the dispatch process is broken because technicians complain about it. Let's redesign the routing system."
  after="H0: Current dispatch routing has no significant effect on first-visit resolution. H1: Geographic clustering in dispatch reduces travel time by >15%. We will test with 6 months of dispatch data against resolution outcomes."

## Testing and Interpreting Results

<Callout type="warning" title="Rejecting H0 Does Not Prove Causation">
Rejecting the null hypothesis demonstrates a statistically significant relationship — it does not prove that one variable causes the other. Correlation findings must be supplemented with qualitative validation, domain expertise, and where possible, controlled testing before claiming causation.
</Callout>

## Building the Tree Iteratively

Start with 3-5 top-level branches and expand as data reveals new dimensions. AI can suggest additional branches based on patterns it finds in the data, but the practitioner must validate each addition against the MECE framework to prevent overlap or gaps.

| Level | Example (Metro Cable) |
|-------|----------------------|
| L1 Branch | Dispatch Efficiency |
| L2 Sub-issue | Geographic routing optimization |
| L2 Sub-issue | Technician skill-matching accuracy |
| L1 Branch | Customer Experience |
| L2 Sub-issue | First-call resolution rate |
| L2 Sub-issue | Appointment window accuracy |
