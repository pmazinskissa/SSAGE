# Data Visualization

AI-enabled data visualization transforms raw data into interpretable visual patterns far faster than traditional tools. By describing what you want to see in natural language, practitioners can generate complex visualizations in seconds, iterate on them rapidly, and uncover patterns that might take hours to find through manual exploration.

## AI-Enabled Visualization Approach

Rather than spending days learning visualization tool syntax or building dashboard configurations, AOMT practitioners describe their visualization needs directly to AI. The AI generates the visualization, and the practitioner interprets the results and requests refinements.

### Common Visualization Types

| Visualization | Use Case | When to Apply |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| Geographic heat maps | Spatial pattern analysis | Service area optimization, regional performance |
| Time series plots | Trend identification | Volume patterns, seasonal effects, before/after |
| Distribution charts | Spread and outlier analysis | Performance variation, workload balance |
| Correlation matrices | Relationship mapping | Multi-variable hypothesis testing |
| Sankey diagrams | Process flow analysis | Customer journey, escalation paths |

## Example: Geographic Mapping

<PromptExample
  prompt="Using the dispatch dataset, create a geographic heat map showing first-visit resolution rates by service zone. Overlay technician home base locations as points. Color-code zones from red (below 60% resolution) to green (above 85% resolution). Include a legend and label the 5 worst-performing zones."
  response="Here is the geographic heat map of first-visit resolution rates across 47 service zones. Key findings: The 5 worst-performing zones (Southeast-12, Northeast-7, Central-3, West-19, South-22) are clustered in areas where average technician travel distance exceeds 45 minutes. Three of these zones have no technician home base within the zone boundary, suggesting a geographic coverage gap rather than a skill gap."

<Callout type="tip" title="Speed Advantage">
A visualization that would take 2-4 hours to build in traditional tools (data preparation, tool configuration, formatting) can be generated in under 2 minutes through AI prompting. This speed enables practitioners to explore dozens of visual perspectives in a single analysis session, dramatically increasing the likelihood of discovering meaningful patterns.

## Iterating on Visualizations

The real power of AI-enabled visualization is rapid iteration. After reviewing the initial output, request modifications:

- "Zoom into the Southeast-12 zone and show individual dispatch points"
- "Add a time dimension — show how resolution rates changed quarter over quarter"
- "Overlay weather data to check for seasonal correlation"

Each iteration takes seconds, enabling a conversational exploration of the data that is impossible with traditional tools.

## Practice: Craft a Visualization Prompt

<ReflectionPrompt
  question="You have an employee roster containing technician names, hire dates, certifications, and zone assignments. Write a specific AI prompt to generate a useful visualization of workforce experience levels. Consider: What chart type? What grouping categories? What colors and labels? What title?"
  answer="Sample prompt: 'Using the attached employee roster file, create a bar chart showing the distribution of technicians by years of experience (0-2, 3-5, 6-10, 10+ years). Use blue bars, include exact counts above each bar, and title the chart Technician Experience Distribution.' Key elements of a strong visualization prompt: specific chart type, clear grouping categories, color specification, data labels, and a descriptive title."
