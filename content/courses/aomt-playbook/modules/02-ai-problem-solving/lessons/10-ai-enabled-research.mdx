# AI-Enabled Research

Beyond analyzing internal data, AI accelerates external research — benchmarking against industry standards, identifying best practices, and exploring adjacent domains for transferable solutions. This research capability turns every practitioner into a research team.

## Benchmarking with AI

AI can rapidly compile benchmark data from public sources, industry reports, and academic literature. This enables practitioners to contextualize their findings against external standards within minutes rather than days.

<PromptExample
  prompt="Research industry benchmarks for First Call Resolution (FCR) in the telecommunications field service sector. Include: (1) overall industry average, (2) top-quartile performance, (3) bottom-quartile performance, (4) trend over the past 5 years, and (5) the primary factors that differentiate top performers from bottom performers."
  response="Based on industry data: (1) The telecommunications field service FCR industry average is 73%. (2) Top-quartile performers achieve 85-92% FCR. (3) Bottom-quartile performers fall below 65% FCR. (4) Industry FCR has improved approximately 2% per year over the past 5 years, driven largely by AI-assisted dispatch and predictive parts inventory. (5) Key differentiators for top performers include: skill-based routing (matching technician certifications to job requirements), predictive parts loading (ensuring the right parts are on the truck), and geographic optimization (minimizing travel time to maximize jobs per day)."

<Callout type="warning" title="Verify AI Research">
AI-generated benchmarks and statistics must be verified against primary sources. Request citations, cross-reference with published industry reports, and validate with subject matter experts. Use AI research as a starting point for deeper investigation, not as a final source of truth.
</Callout>

## Research Applications

- **Industry benchmarking** — How does the client compare to peers?
- **Best practice identification** — What approaches have worked in similar contexts?
- **Technology landscape** — What tools and platforms are available for a given problem?
- **Regulatory context** — What compliance requirements affect potential solutions?
- **Academic literature** — What research supports or challenges the hypotheses?

<Callout type="tip" title="Sensitivity Analysis">
When AI provides benchmark ranges (e.g., "top-quartile FCR is 85-92%"), use these ranges to run sensitivity analyses on your opportunity sizing. Model the conservative case (85%), the expected case (88%), and the optimistic case (92%) to give stakeholders a realistic view of the opportunity range.
</Callout>

## Combining Internal and External Research

The most compelling findings emerge when internal data analysis and external research converge. When your data shows a metric at 65% and external benchmarks show top performers at 90%, the gap becomes a quantified, benchmarked opportunity that stakeholders can act on with confidence.
