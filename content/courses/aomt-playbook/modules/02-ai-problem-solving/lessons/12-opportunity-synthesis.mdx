# Opportunity Synthesis

Synthesis is the bridge between analysis and action. It transforms validated findings into clearly articulated opportunities, each with quantified impact and a range of potential solutions. This is where the practitioner's judgment becomes most critical — connecting data patterns to operational improvements.

## From Findings to Opportunities

Not every finding becomes an opportunity. The synthesis process filters validated findings through three lenses:

1. **Magnitude** — Is the gap large enough to warrant action? A statistically significant finding with minimal operational impact may not justify investment.
2. **Actionability** — Can this gap be addressed with available resources and technology? A finding without a feasible solution path remains an observation, not an opportunity.
3. **Alignment** — Does addressing this gap support the organization's strategic priorities? Even large, actionable gaps may be deprioritized if they don't align with current objectives.

## Developing the Option Set

For each opportunity, develop 2-4 solution options that span a range of ambition and investment:

<Callout type="concept" title="Option Set Design">
Every opportunity should present stakeholders with genuine choices, not a predetermined answer. A well-designed option set typically includes: (1) a quick win with modest investment and near-term payoff, (2) a moderate option balancing investment and impact, (3) a transformational option with significant investment and maximum long-term value, and optionally (4) a do-nothing baseline that quantifies the cost of inaction.
</Callout>

| Option Type | Investment | Timeline | Impact | Risk |
|------------|-----------|----------|--------|------|
| Quick Win | Low | 1-3 months | Moderate | Low |
| Moderate | Medium | 3-6 months | Significant | Medium |
| Transformational | High | 6-18 months | Maximum | Higher |
| Do Nothing | None | N/A | Continued decline | Compounding |

<Callout type="tip" title="Always Include a Quick Win">
Every option set should include at least one quick win. Quick wins build stakeholder confidence, demonstrate the value of the approach, and generate momentum for larger initiatives. They also provide early data points that validate the analytical findings in a real operational setting.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Verify Transformational Options">
Transformational options must be grounded in realistic capability assessments. Before presenting a transformational option, verify with IT, operations, and finance that the required technology, talent, and budget are plausibly attainable. An aspirational option that is clearly infeasible damages practitioner credibility.
</Callout>

## Structuring the Synthesis Output

Each synthesized opportunity should be documented with:
- **Opportunity Title** — A clear, action-oriented name
- **Supporting Findings** — The validated data points that justify this opportunity
- **Quantified Impact** — The estimated value in operational metrics and financial terms
- **Option Set** — The 2-4 solution options with comparative analysis
- **Dependencies** — What must be true for each option to succeed
- **Recommended Next Step** — What should happen immediately to advance this opportunity
