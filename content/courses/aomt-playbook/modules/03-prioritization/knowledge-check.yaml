    question: "What does WSJF stand for?"
    options:
      - id: "a"
        text: "Weighted Scoring of Job Features"
      - id: "b"
        text: "Weighted Shortest Job First"
      - id: "c"
        text: "Work Sequence for Job Fulfillment"
      - id: "d"
        text: "Weighted Strategy for Joint Feasibility"
    correct_option: "b"
    explanation: "WSJF stands for Weighted Shortest Job First, a prioritization method that calculates the cost of delay divided by job duration to rank opportunities."

  - id: "m3-q2"
    type: "true-false"
    question: "In the Value vs. Complexity Matrix, opportunities in the 'High Value, Low Complexity' quadrant should be prioritized first."
    correct_answer: true
    explanation: "Correct. High Value, Low Complexity opportunities (often called 'Quick Wins') deliver the most impact with the least effort and should be prioritized to build momentum and demonstrate early value."

  - id: "m3-q3"
    type: "multiple-choice-single"
    question: "Which component is NOT part of the Cost of Delay calculation in WSJF?"
    options:
      - id: "a"
        text: "User/Business Value"
      - id: "b"
        text: "Time Criticality"
      - id: "c"
        text: "Risk Reduction / Opportunity Enablement"
      - id: "d"
        text: "Team Velocity"
    correct_option: "d"
    explanation: "Cost of Delay in WSJF is calculated from User/Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction/Opportunity Enablement. Team Velocity is not a component of Cost of Delay."

  - id: "m3-q4"
    type: "matching"
    question: "Match each quadrant of the Value vs. Complexity Matrix with the recommended action:"
    pairs:
      - id: "quick-win"
        left: "High Value, Low Complexity"
        right: "Prioritize immediately (Quick Win)"
      - id: "strategic"
        left: "High Value, High Complexity"
        right: "Plan strategically with phased delivery"
      - id: "low-priority"
        left: "Low Value, Low Complexity"
        right: "Consider if resources allow"
      - id: "avoid"
        left: "Low Value, High Complexity"
        right: "Deprioritize or eliminate"
    explanation: "The matrix guides decision-making: Quick Wins first, Strategic projects with careful planning, Low Priority when resources permit, and avoid High Complexity / Low Value work."

  - id: "m3-q5"
    type: "multiple-choice-multi"
    question: "Which of the following should be included in an Opportunity Documentation template? (Select all that apply)"
    options:
      - id: "a"
        text: "Opportunity description and quantified impact"
      - id: "b"
        text: "Supporting data and diagnostic evidence"
      - id: "c"
        text: "Detailed technical implementation plan"
      - id: "d"
        text: "Stakeholders affected and alignment status"
    correct_options:
      - "a"
      - "b"
      - "d"
    explanation: "Opportunity Documentation captures the what, why, and who — not the detailed how. Technical implementation plans come later during the tool development phase."
