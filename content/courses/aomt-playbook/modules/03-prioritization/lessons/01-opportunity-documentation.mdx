# Opportunity Documentation

Before opportunities can be prioritized, they must be documented in a standardized format that enables objective comparison. The opportunity documentation template ensures that every opportunity is described with sufficient rigor to support scoring, stakeholder review, and implementation planning.

## Documentation Template

Every opportunity document should contain these 8 elements:

1. **Opportunity Title** — A concise, action-oriented name that describes the improvement (e.g., "Implement AI-Optimized Dispatch Routing for Field Service")

2. **Problem Summary** — A 2-3 sentence description of the validated gap, referencing the specific data findings that support it

3. **Quantified Impact** — The estimated operational and financial value of closing the gap, including the methodology used to calculate it

4. **Affected Stakeholders** — Who benefits from this improvement and who is impacted by the change

5. **Solution Options** — The 2-4 options developed during synthesis, with comparative investment, timeline, and risk profiles

6. **Dependencies** — Technical, organizational, or resource prerequisites that must be met for implementation

7. **Risks and Mitigations** — Known risks for each solution option and proposed mitigation strategies

8. **Supporting Evidence** — References to specific analyses, visualizations, benchmarks, and stakeholder validations that underpin the opportunity

<Callout type="concept" title="Grounded in Validated Findings">
Every element of the opportunity document must trace back to validated findings from the diagnostic phase. If a claim cannot be linked to a specific analysis result, benchmark comparison, or stakeholder validation, it should be flagged as an assumption and treated with appropriate caution during prioritization.

## Metro Cable Example

In the Metro Cable case study, the dispatch optimization opportunity was documented as follows:

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Title | AI-Optimized Geographic Dispatch Routing |
| Problem Summary | First-visit resolution rate (62%) is 23 points below top-quartile benchmark (85%), driven primarily by geographic misalignment between technician locations and job sites |
| Quantified Impact | Estimated 18-point FCR improvement worth $2.4M annually in reduced truck rolls and improved customer satisfaction |
| Affected Stakeholders | Field technicians (daily workflow change), dispatch coordinators (new tool adoption), customers (improved service windows) |

<Callout type="tip" title="Use AI to Draft Documentation">
AI can generate initial documentation drafts from your analysis outputs. Provide the AI with your validated findings, benchmark comparisons, and synthesis notes, and ask it to structure them into the 8-element template. The practitioner then reviews, refines, and validates the draft.
