# Prioritization Methods Overview

With validated opportunities documented, **Phase 2** begins: prioritization. The goal is to rank opportunities based on business value, time criticality, risk reduction, and implementation effort — then sequence them into an actionable roadmap.

The methodology provides two complementary prioritization methods. The right choice depends on the maturity of your opportunity documentation, the number of opportunities, and the audience.

**Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)** is a quantitative scoring framework borrowed from SAFe and Lean portfolio management. It ranks opportunities by dividing their "Cost of Delay" (business value + time criticality + risk reduction) by their estimated implementation effort. The result is a single numeric score that produces a defensible, rank-ordered backlog.

**The Value vs. Complexity Matrix** is a visual 2x2 grid that plots opportunities by their expected value against their implementation complexity. It is faster to execute than WSJF, requires less data, and produces a quadrant placement (Quick Wins, Strategic Bets, Fill-Ins, Avoid) that stakeholders can absorb at a glance.

## Comparing the Two Methods

| Factor | WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First) | Value vs. Complexity Matrix |
|--------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Complexity** | Higher — scoring 4 dimensions on a 1–10 scale | Lower — qualitative 2×2 grid placement |
| **Time Required** | 90–120 minutes for 5–7 opportunities | 45–60 minutes for the same set |
| **Best For** | Agile environments, large portfolios (10+ opportunities) | Quick prioritization, smaller sets (3–5) |
| **Output** | Rank-ordered list with numerical scores | Quadrant placement with action guidance |
| **Stakeholder Buy-In** | Strong — transparent, repeatable scoring justifies decisions | Strong — visual simplicity resonates with executives |

## When to Use Each Method

<Callout type="concept" title="WSJF">
Use WSJF when opportunities are **well-documented and quantified**, the portfolio is large enough to benefit from precise sequencing, and the audience is comfortable with structured scoring. WSJF produces a defensible, rank-ordered backlog that maps directly to agile delivery planning.
</Callout>

<Callout type="concept" title="Value vs. Complexity Matrix">
Use the Matrix when opportunities are at an **early stage**, stakeholder alignment is the primary goal, or the portfolio needs rapid triage before deeper analysis. The visual format is one of the most effective executive presentation tools available.
</Callout>

## Recommended Approach: Use Both

<Callout type="tip" title="Combine for Maximum Impact">
Start with the **Value vs. Complexity Matrix** in a stakeholder workshop to build consensus on which quadrant each opportunity belongs in. Then apply **WSJF scoring** to the Quick Wins and Strategic Bets quadrants for precise sequencing. This two-pass approach leverages the strengths of both methods: the Matrix builds alignment, WSJF builds the roadmap.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Consistency Over Methodology">
The specific methodology matters less than **consistent application** and stakeholder buy-in. Pick one approach (or the combined approach), apply it rigorously, and use the results to drive decisions. Switching methods mid-process or applying them inconsistently undermines credibility.
</Callout>
