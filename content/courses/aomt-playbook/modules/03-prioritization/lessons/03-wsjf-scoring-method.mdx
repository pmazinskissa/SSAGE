# WSJF Scoring Method

<GlossaryTerm term="WSJF">Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)</GlossaryTerm> is a prioritization framework that ranks opportunities by the ratio of their value to their implementation cost. It ensures that the highest-value, lowest-effort opportunities rise to the top of the roadmap.

## The WSJF Formula

**WSJF = Cost of Delay / Job Size**

Where **Cost of Delay** is the sum of three value components:

- **Business Value** — The direct operational or financial impact of implementing this opportunity
- **Time Criticality** — How much value is lost by delaying implementation (regulatory deadlines, competitive pressure, compounding costs)
- **Risk Reduction / Opportunity Enablement** — The degree to which this opportunity reduces organizational risk or enables future opportunities

## Scoring Components

Each component is scored on a relative scale. The recommended approach uses <GlossaryTerm term="Fibonacci Sequence">Fibonacci-like values (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)</GlossaryTerm> to force meaningful differentiation between items.

| Component | Score 1 (Low) | Score 5 (Medium) | Score 13 (High) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Business Value | Marginal efficiency gain, limited scope | Meaningful improvement to a core process | Transformative impact on revenue or cost structure |
| Time Criticality | No deadline pressure, value stable over time | Moderate urgency, value declines 10-20% per quarter if delayed | Critical deadline or rapidly compounding cost of inaction |
| Risk Reduction | Minimal risk mitigation | Addresses a known operational or compliance risk | Eliminates a critical vulnerability or enables a strategic initiative |
| Job Size (divisor) | Small effort, 1-2 sprints, existing capabilities | Moderate effort, 3-5 sprints, some new capability needed | Large effort, 6+ sprints, significant new infrastructure or skills |

<Callout type="warning" title="Job Size Is the Divisor">
Job Size divides the Cost of Delay, so a higher Job Size score results in a lower WSJF priority. This means that large, complex initiatives must deliver proportionally higher value to rank above smaller, simpler ones. This built-in bias toward smaller efforts is intentional — it favors incremental delivery and faster time to value.

<Callout type="tip" title="T-Shirt Sizing for Speed">
When scoring a large number of opportunities, start with T-shirt sizing (S, M, L, XL) for each component, then convert to numeric scores. This approach is faster for initial triage and can be refined with more precise scoring for the top-ranked items.
</Callout>

<Callout type="concept" title="Metro Cable WSJF Scoring Example">
For Metro Cable, the team scored three top opportunities:

| Opportunity | Business Value | Time Criticality | Risk Reduction | Cost of Delay | Job Size | WSJF |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|----------|------|
| AI Dispatch Routing Pilot | 13 | 8 | 5 | 26 | 2 | **13.0** |
| Technician Skill-Match Algorithm | 8 | 8 | 5 | 21 | 2 | **10.5** |
| Predictive Maintenance Alerting | 8 | 5 | 13 | 26 | 5 | **5.2** |

The dispatch routing pilot scored highest because it combined strong business value with high time criticality (customer churn was accelerating) and a small job size (existing data, proven algorithm patterns). Predictive maintenance scored lower despite equal Cost of Delay because its job size was significantly larger.
</Callout>

## Generating the Prioritized Roadmap

Once all opportunities are scored, sort them by WSJF score (highest first) to generate the prioritized roadmap.

<PromptExample
  prompt="Using the WSJF scores in the attached opportunity matrix, create a prioritized implementation roadmap. Group opportunities into three horizons: Horizon 1 (immediate, next 90 days), Horizon 2 (near-term, 90-180 days), and Horizon 3 (strategic, 180+ days). For each horizon, list the opportunities in WSJF priority order with their scores and estimated implementation effort."
  response="Prioritized Implementation Roadmap:\n\nHorizon 1 (Next 90 Days) — WSJF > 8.0:\n1. AI Dispatch Routing Pilot (WSJF: 13.0, Effort: S)\n2. Technician Skill-Match Algorithm (WSJF: 10.5, Effort: S)\n3. Parts Inventory Prediction Model (WSJF: 8.7, Effort: M)\n\nHorizon 2 (90-180 Days) — WSJF 4.0-8.0:\n4. Customer Self-Service Portal Redesign (WSJF: 6.5, Effort: M)\n5. Predictive Maintenance Alerting (WSJF: 5.2, Effort: L)\n\nHorizon 3 (180+ Days) — WSJF < 4.0:\n6. Full Network Digital Twin (WSJF: 3.1, Effort: XL)\n7. Autonomous Dispatch System (WSJF: 2.8, Effort: XL)"
