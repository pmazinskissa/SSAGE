questions:
  - id: "m4-q1"
    type: "multiple-choice-single"
    question: "Which prototyping principle states that a working prototype communicates more effectively than any requirements document?"
    options:
      - id: "a"
        text: "Start with the User"
      - id: "b"
        text: "Show, Don't Tell"
      - id: "c"
        text: "Fail Fast, Learn Faster"
      - id: "d"
        text: "Data In, Decision Out"
    correct_option: "b"
    explanation: "'Show, Don't Tell' emphasizes building the simplest working version that demonstrates the core value proposition, rather than relying on documentation to convey the concept."

  - id: "m4-q2"
    type: "true-false"
    question: "In AI-Enabled Problem Solving, you should complete a detailed requirements document before building any prototype."
    correct_answer: false
    explanation: "False. The methodology emphasizes rapid prototyping where AI tools enable practitioners to build functional prototypes in days rather than months, prioritizing working software over comprehensive documentation."

  - id: "m4-q3"
    type: "drag-to-rank"
    question: "Rank the four prototyping principles in the order they are presented in the methodology:"
    items:
      - id: "user"
        text: "Start with the User"
      - id: "show"
        text: "Show, Don't Tell"
      - id: "fail"
        text: "Fail Fast, Learn Faster"
      - id: "data"
        text: "Data In, Decision Out"
    correct_order:
      - "user"
      - "show"
      - "fail"
      - "data"
    explanation: "The four principles follow a logical progression: understand the user first, demonstrate with a working prototype, iterate quickly based on feedback, and ensure the complete data-to-decision flow works."

  - id: "m4-q4"
    type: "multiple-choice-single"
    question: "What is the correct User Story format used in AI tool development?"
    options:
      - id: "a"
        text: "Given [context], When [action], Then [result]"
      - id: "b"
        text: "As a [role], I want [capability] so that [benefit]"
      - id: "c"
        text: "In order to [goal], as a [role], I need [feature]"
      - id: "d"
        text: "When [trigger], the system shall [behavior]"
    correct_option: "b"
    explanation: "The methodology uses the standard user story format: 'As a [role], I want [capability] so that [benefit]' — keeping the focus on user needs and value delivery."

  - id: "m4-q5"
    type: "fill-in-blank"
    question: "Complete the sentence about prototype validation."
    word_bank:
      - "security"
      - "feasibility"
      - "scalability"
      - "cost"
    segments:
      - type: "text"
        value: "Before investing significant time in prototype development, confirm technical "
      - type: "blank"
        value: "feasibility"
        accept:
          - "feasibility"
      - type: "text"
        value: " with IT and "
      - type: "blank"
        value: "security"
        accept:
          - "security"
      - type: "text"
        value: " teams."
    explanation: "Validating technical feasibility and security requirements early prevents wasted effort on prototypes that cannot be deployed due to technical or compliance constraints."

  - id: "m4-q6"
    type: "multiple-choice-multi"
    question: "Which of the following should you validate with IT before building an AI prototype? (Select all that apply)"
    options:
      - id: "a"
        text: "Data access permissions"
      - id: "b"
        text: "User interface color scheme"
      - id: "c"
        text: "Integration requirements"
      - id: "d"
        text: "Compliance constraints"
    correct_options:
      - "a"
      - "c"
      - "d"
    explanation: "Before prototyping, validate data access permissions, integration requirements, deployment infrastructure, and compliance constraints with IT. UI aesthetics are design decisions, not IT validation items."
