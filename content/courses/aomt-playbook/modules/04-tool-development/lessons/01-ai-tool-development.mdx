# AI Tool Development

With opportunities prioritized and a roadmap in hand, the process moves from diagnosis to solution development. This chapter covers how to translate validated opportunities into AI-powered tools and solutions that deliver measurable operational improvement.

## From Opportunity to Solution

The transition from opportunity to solution requires a fundamental shift in thinking. During diagnosis, the practitioner asks "What is wrong and why?" During tool development, the question becomes "What AI-powered solution best addresses this validated gap?"

<Callout type="concept" title="AI First Design">
Solutions are designed AI First. Rather than automating an existing manual process step-by-step, AI First design asks: "If we were building this capability from scratch with full access to AI, what would it look like?" This approach often yields solutions that are fundamentally different from — and dramatically more effective than — incremental automation of legacy processes.

## Types of AI Solutions

AI solutions fall into three categories, each with different levels of autonomy and human involvement:

<ProcessFlow steps={[
  { title: "Agentic Solutions", description: "Fully autonomous AI systems that make decisions and take actions independently within defined guardrails. Example: An AI dispatch system that automatically assigns technicians to jobs based on real-time optimization of skills, location, and availability." },
  { title: "Assistive Solutions", description: "AI tools that augment human decision-making by providing recommendations, insights, or draft outputs for human review. Example: An AI assistant that suggests optimal dispatch assignments but requires coordinator approval before execution." },
  { title: "Automation Solutions", description: "Rule-based or AI-enhanced systems that handle repetitive, well-defined tasks without human intervention. Example: Automated scheduling confirmations and reminder messages triggered by dispatch assignments." }
]} />

## Selecting the Right Solution Type

The choice between agentic, assistive, and automation depends on three factors:

| Factor | Favors Agentic | Favors Assistive | Favors Automation |
|--------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Decision complexity | Low-medium, well-defined rules | High, requires judgment | Low, deterministic |
| Error tolerance | Errors are recoverable and low-cost | Errors are costly or visible | Errors are rare with clear rules |
| Speed requirement | Real-time decisions needed | Human review time is acceptable | Batch processing is sufficient |

<Callout type="tip" title="Metro Cable Dispatch Example">
For Metro Cable, the dispatch optimization opportunity was designed as an assistive solution for the initial deployment — the AI recommends dispatch assignments, but coordinators review and approve them. This builds trust, generates training data for the AI model, and provides a transition path toward a fully agentic solution once accuracy thresholds are proven.
