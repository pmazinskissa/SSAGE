# Design & Prototype

Prototyping moves fast. AI tools enable practitioners to build functional prototypes in days rather than months, allowing stakeholders to interact with working solutions early and provide feedback that shapes the final product.

## 4 Prototyping Principles

<DesignPrototypeStages />

1. **Start with the Users** — Every prototype begins with a clear understanding of who will use it and what task they need to accomplish. Observe current workflows before designing new ones.

2. **Show, Don't Tell** — A working prototype communicates more effectively than any review of documented requirements. Build the simplest version that demonstrates the core value proposition.

3. **Fail Fast, Learn Faster** — Prototypes are designed to be disposable. Build them quickly, test them with real users, and iterate or pivot based on feedback. Getting attached to a prototype is the enemy of good design.

4. **Data In, Decision Out** — Every AI tool prototype should demonstrate the complete flow from data input to actionable output. Stakeholders need to see the end-to-end value, not just a technology demo.



## Epic and User Story Structure

Translate the opportunity and solution design into structured development artifacts:

<Callout type="concept" title="From Opportunity to Backlog">
An **Epic** represents the overall solution (e.g., "AI-Optimized Dispatch Routing"). Each Epic contains multiple **User Stories** that describe specific capabilities from the user's perspective. User Stories follow the format: "As a [role], I want [capability] so that [benefit]."
</Callout>

<PromptExample
  prompt="Based on the AI dispatch routing opportunity, generate a set of user stories for the MVP prototype. The primary users are dispatch coordinators and field technicians. Focus on the core dispatch optimization workflow. Format each story as: As a [role], I want [capability] so that [benefit]. Include acceptance criteria for each story."
  response="**Epic: AI-Optimized Dispatch Routing MVP**\n\n**Story 1:** As a dispatch coordinator, I want to see AI-recommended technician assignments for each incoming job so that I can make faster, better-informed routing decisions.\n- *Acceptance Criteria:* Recommendations appear within 5 seconds of job creation; each recommendation includes match score and reasoning.\n\n**Story 2:** As a dispatch coordinator, I want to approve, modify, or reject AI recommendations so that I maintain control over final assignments.\n- *Acceptance Criteria:* One-click approve; drag-and-drop reassignment; rejection requires reason code.\n\n**Story 3:** As a field technician, I want to see my optimized daily route on a map so that I can minimize travel time between jobs.\n- *Acceptance Criteria:* Map updates in real-time; shows estimated travel time between stops; recalculates when jobs are added or removed.\n\n**Story 4:** As a dispatch coordinator, I want to see a dashboard comparing AI recommendations vs. actual assignments so that I can track how often I override the AI and why.\n- *Acceptance Criteria:* Daily summary of accept/modify/reject rates; filterable by coordinator, zone, and job type."

<Callout type="warning" title="Verify with IT Early">
Before investing significant time in prototype development, confirm the technical feasibility with IT and security teams. Confirm data access permissions, integration requirements, deployment infrastructure, and compliance constraints. A technically infeasible prototype wastes everyone's time and erodes stakeholder trust.

## Prototype Testing

Test prototypes with real users performing real tasks. Observe where they struggle, what questions they ask, and what features they ignore. This qualitative feedback is as valuable as any quantitative metric.
