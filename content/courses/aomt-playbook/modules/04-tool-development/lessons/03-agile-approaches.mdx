# Projects vs. Agile Approaches

The choice between traditional project management and agile delivery significantly impacts the success of AI solution implementation. Understanding when to use each approach — and why this methodology generally favors agile — is essential for practitioners.

<BeforeAfter
  before="Requirements are gathered upfront and frozen. A detailed project plan spans 6-12 months. Development proceeds through sequential phases (design, build, test, deploy). Changes require formal change requests and re-planning. Users see the solution only at final delivery."
  after="Requirements are captured as a prioritized backlog and refined continuously. Work is delivered in 2-week sprints. Each sprint produces a working increment that users can test. Feedback directly shapes the next sprint. The solution evolves through rapid iteration toward product-market fit."

## When to Use Each Approach

<Callout type="tip" title="When Traditional Project Management Fits">
Use a traditional project approach when requirements are well-understood and unlikely to change, when the solution is based on proven technology with predictable outcomes, when regulatory or contractual obligations require fixed scope and timeline, or when the work is primarily infrastructure deployment rather than software development.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="When Agile Fits">
Use agile when the solution involves AI or machine learning (where model performance is uncertain until tested with real data), when user adoption depends on iterative refinement of the interface and workflow, when the problem space is complex and requirements will evolve as understanding deepens, or when speed to initial value is more important than completeness at launch.
</Callout>

## Recommendation for AI Solutions

<Callout type="concept" title="Default to Agile for AI">
This methodology strongly recommends agile delivery for AI-powered solutions. AI solutions are inherently experimental — model accuracy, user acceptance, and operational impact cannot be fully predicted from requirements documents alone. Agile delivery allows practitioners to test hypotheses about solution effectiveness with the same rigor they applied to testing diagnostic hypotheses.
</Callout>

## Key Agile Concepts for Practitioners

| Concept | Definition | Application |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| Sprint | A fixed time period (typically 2 weeks) for delivering a working increment | Each sprint should deliver a testable improvement to the AI solution |
| Backlog | A prioritized list of work items (user stories, bugs, technical tasks) | Maintained by the Product Owner / Product Manager, informed by WSJF prioritization |
| Sprint Review | A demonstration of completed work to stakeholders | Critical for maintaining stakeholder engagement and gathering feedback |
| Retrospective | A team reflection on what went well and what to improve | Applies the same continuous improvement mindset to the delivery process |

<DecisionPoint
  scenario="Your client wants to deploy an AI-powered dispatching solution. The VP of IT insists on a 6-month waterfall plan with fixed requirements. The field operations team wants to start testing a prototype next week. How do you proceed?"
  options={[
    { id: "waterfall", label: "Agree to the waterfall plan", outcome: "This keeps the VP of IT happy but risks building a solution based on untested assumptions. After 6 months, you may discover the solution doesn't fit actual workflows — and by then, stakeholder patience may be exhausted." },
    { id: "agile", label: "Propose a hybrid approach", outcome: "Suggest a 2-sprint proof of concept (4 weeks) that satisfies IT governance requirements while delivering a testable prototype to field operations. This builds evidence that can earn executive buy-in for continued agile delivery.", recommended: true },
    { id: "field", label: "Start with field operations immediately", outcome: "Moving fast with the willing team builds momentum, but bypassing IT governance creates organizational risk. The solution may face blockers at deployment if IT wasn't involved from the start." }
