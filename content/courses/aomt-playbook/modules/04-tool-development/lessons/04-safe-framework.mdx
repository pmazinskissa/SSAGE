# Agile Development Methods

The <GlossaryTerm term="Agile">Agile framework</GlossaryTerm> provides a structured approach to Agile delivery at enterprise scale. For engagements that involve multiple teams, complex integrations, or organization-wide deployment, Agile offers the coordination mechanisms needed to maintain agility without chaos.

<Callout type="note" title="A Note on Terminology">
Organizations often adapt Agile terminology to fit their context. Role titles, ceremony names, and artifact labels may differ from what is described here. The underlying principles — iterative delivery, cross-team coordination, and continuous feedback — remain consistent regardless of naming conventions.
</Callout>

## The 5-Step Agile Process

<ProcessFlow steps={[
  { title: "Define the Backlog", description: "Translate prioritized opportunities and user stories into a structured product backlog. Use WSJF scoring to sequence backlog items for maximum value delivery." },
  { title: "Plan the Increment", description: "Conduct Program Increment (PI) Planning to align multiple teams on shared objectives, identify dependencies, and commit to delivery targets for the next 8-12 week increment." },
  { title: "Execute Sprints", description: "Teams work in 2-week sprints, delivering working increments and conducting regular demos. Cross-team synchronization occurs through Scrum of Scrums and shared integration environments." },
  { title: "Review and Adapt", description: "At the end of each Program Increment, conduct a system demo and Inspect & Adapt workshop. Assess what was delivered against plan, identify systemic impediments, and adjust the approach." },
  { title: "Continuous Delivery", description: "Establish a continuous delivery pipeline that enables frequent, reliable releases to production. AI models are versioned and deployed through the same pipeline as application code." }

## The Product Owner / Product Manager Role

<Callout type="concept" title="Product Owner / Product Manager as Bridge">
The Product Owner / Product Manager is the critical link between the practitioner team and the development teams. They translate validated opportunities and prioritized requirements into actionable backlog items, make scope trade-off decisions within sprints, and ensure that what gets built aligns with what the diagnostic data recommends. The Product Owner / Product Manager should have deep familiarity with the diagnostic findings.
</Callout>

## Key Agile Artifacts

| Artifact | Purpose | Connection |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Product Backlog | Prioritized list of features and capabilities | Directly derived from WSJF-scored opportunity roadmap |
| Program Board | Visual dependency map across teams | Critical for AI solutions with data pipeline, model, and UI components |
| PI Objectives | Measurable goals for each increment | Linked to the success measures defined in the Problem Statement |
| Iteration Metrics | Sprint-level delivery and quality metrics | Used to track velocity and predict delivery timelines |

<Callout type="tip" title="Feedback Becomes Backlog">
In Agile, user feedback from sprint demos and production usage is systematically captured and fed back into the product backlog. This creates a virtuous cycle where every deployment generates insights that improve the next iteration. For AI solutions, this feedback loop is essential — model performance in production often reveals optimization opportunities that were not visible during development.
</Callout>

## Agile Stages and Key Roles

<AgileStagesRoles />

The Agile lifecycle flows through three stages, each with distinct roles and responsibilities:



### Stage 1: Assess & Plan

- **Organization Leaders** provide vision and direction based on diagnostic findings
- **Program Office** develops roadmaps using Economic View (ROI analysis) and Systems Thinking (big picture)
- **Architecture Review Board (ARB)** confirms system architecture is robust and approves plans before hand-over to build teams
- **Voice of Customer (VOC)** and **Voice of the Marketplace (VOM)** inform requirements and strategic direction

### Stage 2: Agile Design, Build, Test

- **Product Owners / Product Managers** drive adherence to the roadmap and manage the product backlog
- **Scrum Masters** manage build teams and remove roadblocks
- **Agile Build Teams** develop incremental features in sprint cycles

<Callout type="concept" title="Develop on Cadence, Deliver on Demand">
Teams work in consistent sprints but deploy when features are ready and business conditions are optimal. This decouples the development rhythm from the release schedule, enabling both predictability and flexibility.
</Callout>

### Stage 3: Deploy & Adopt Users

- **Business Leaders** sign off on delivery requirements and confirm readiness
- **Release Management** coordinates deployment logistics and rollback plans
- **Change Management Team** ensures end users are prepared, trained, and supported
- Continuous feedback flows back to Stage 1, creating a virtuous improvement cycle

<Callout type="warning" title="Right-Size the Framework">
Agile is designed for large-scale, multi-team efforts. For smaller engagements with a single development team, basic Scrum or Kanban may be more appropriate. Applying Agile to a small team adds unnecessary overhead. Match the framework to the scale of the effort.
</Callout>
