    question: "What are the three pillars of the AOMT Sustainment Framework?"
    options:
      - id: "a"
        text: "Plan, Execute, Monitor"
      - id: "b"
        text: "Structure, Support, Feedback"
      - id: "c"
        text: "People, Process, Technology"
      - id: "d"
        text: "Design, Build, Deploy"
    correct_option: "b"
    explanation: "The three pillars are Structure (alignment of roles, responsibilities, and incentives), Support (continuous learning and collaboration), and Feedback (goal setting, scorecards, and performance monitoring). All three must be present and reinforcing."

  - id: "m5-q2"
    type: "true-false"
    question: "A 1% weekly decline in a metric is insignificant and does not require attention."
    correct_answer: false
    explanation: "False. A 1% weekly decline compounds to approximately 40% annual decline. Drift is dangerous precisely because it is gradual and invisible until it compounds. This is why regular monitoring cadences with decision triggers are essential."

  - id: "m5-q3"
    type: "multiple-choice-single"
    question: "What is the MOST important characteristic of solution ownership in the sustainment phase?"
    options:
      - id: "a"
        text: "Ownership should be shared across a committee for broad accountability"
      - id: "b"
        text: "A single named individual must be the accountable owner"
      - id: "c"
        text: "The original project team should retain ownership indefinitely"
      - id: "d"
        text: "Ownership should rotate monthly to spread the workload"
    correct_option: "b"
    explanation: "A single accountable owner — not a committee — must be responsible for ongoing performance and evolution. Without clear individual ownership, nobody is responsible for monitoring performance, responding to issues, or evolving the solution."

  - id: "m5-q4"
    type: "matching"
    question: "Match each monitoring cadence with the appropriate focus area:"
    pairs:
      - id: "daily"
        left: "Daily"
        right: "System uptime, AI response time, critical errors"
      - id: "weekly"
        left: "Weekly"
        right: "Adoption rate, override frequency, help desk volume"
      - id: "monthly"
        left: "Monthly"
        right: "Business KPIs (FCR, CSAT), model accuracy trends"
      - id: "quarterly"
        left: "Quarterly"
        right: "Strategic alignment, ROI, roadmap updates"
    explanation: "Each monitoring cadence serves a different purpose: daily catches critical failures, weekly tracks operational adoption, monthly evaluates business impact, and quarterly ensures strategic alignment."

  - id: "m5-q5"
    type: "multiple-choice-multi"
    question: "Which of the following are types of drift that threaten sustained improvements? (Select all that apply)"
    options:
      - id: "a"
        text: "Process drift (user workarounds)"
      - id: "b"
        text: "Model drift (AI accuracy declines)"
      - id: "c"
        text: "Budget drift (costs increase)"
      - id: "d"
        text: "Priority drift (organizational attention shifts)"
      - id: "e"
        text: "Knowledge drift (staff turnover dilutes expertise)"
    correct_options:
      - "a"
      - "b"
      - "d"
      - "e"
    explanation: "The four types of drift identified in the sustainment framework are: process drift, model drift, priority drift, and knowledge drift. While budget changes can be a concern, 'budget drift' is not one of the defined drift categories in the AOMT framework."

      - type: "text"
        value: "."
    explanation: "Without decision triggers, scorecards become passive information displays that people review and ignore. Decision triggers connect observations to the product backlog and drive sprint-level improvements."
