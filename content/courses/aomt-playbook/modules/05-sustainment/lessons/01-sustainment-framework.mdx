# Sustainment Framework

Deploying an AI solution is only the beginning. Without a deliberate sustainment framework, even the most effective solutions will degrade over time as processes drift, knowledge fades, and organizational attention shifts to the next priority. Sustainment ensures that improvements deliver lasting value.

## The Three Pillars

The sustainment framework is built on three interconnected pillars:

<ProcessFlow steps={[
  { title: "Structure (Alignment)", description: "Organizational roles, responsibilities, incentives, and governance structures that keep the solution aligned with operational objectives" },
  { title: "Support (Learning)", description: "Training programs, documentation, help resources, and knowledge management systems that maintain user competency and confidence" },
  { title: "Feedback (Performance)", description: "Monitoring systems, performance metrics, feedback loops, and continuous improvement processes that detect and correct issues before they compound" }
]} />

<Callout type="concept" title="All Three Pillars Are Required">
Structure without Support means people have clear roles but lack the knowledge to perform them. Support without Feedback means people are trained but have no way to know if their performance is meeting standards. Feedback without Structure means data is collected but no one is accountable for acting on it. All three pillars must be present and reinforcing for sustainment to succeed.

## The Drift Problem

<GlossaryTerm term="Drift">Drift</GlossaryTerm> is the gradual degradation of solution effectiveness over time. It occurs when:

- **Process drift** — Users develop workarounds that bypass the intended workflow
- **Model drift** — AI model accuracy declines as underlying data patterns change
- **Priority drift** — Organizational attention shifts and sustainment activities are deprioritized
- **Knowledge drift** — Staff turnover dilutes institutional knowledge about how and why the solution works

<Callout type="warning" title="Drift Is Invisible Until It Compounds">
Drift rarely announces itself. A 1% weekly decline in process adherence compounds to a 40% decline over a year. By the time the degradation becomes visible in operational metrics, significant remediation effort is required. The sustainment framework's primary purpose is to detect and correct drift before it compounds.

## Sustainment Is Not Maintenance

Maintenance is reactive — fixing things when they break. Sustainment is proactive — continuously monitoring, adjusting, and improving to prevent degradation. The sustainment framework assumes that the operational environment is dynamic and that solutions must evolve continuously to remain effective.
