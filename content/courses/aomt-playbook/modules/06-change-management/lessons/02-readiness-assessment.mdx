# Readiness Assessment

The <GlossaryTerm term="Readiness Assessment">Readiness Assessment</GlossaryTerm> builds on the baseline by evaluating three additional dimensions that determine how the organization will respond to the specific changes being proposed. While the baseline measures general change capacity, the assessment evaluates readiness for this particular transformation.

## Dimension 1: Case for Change

The <GlossaryTerm term="Case for Change">Case for Change</GlossaryTerm> answers the fundamental question: "Why must we change, and why now?" A compelling case for change requires:

- **Data-driven urgency** — Quantified evidence of the current-state gap (directly from diagnostic findings)
- **Stakeholder relevance** — Clear articulation of what the change means for each stakeholder group personally
- **Consequence of inaction** — A credible description of what happens if the organization does not change
- **Vision of success** — A tangible picture of what the improved future state looks and feels like

<Callout type="concept" title="Grounded in Diagnostic Findings">
The Case for Change is uniquely powerful because it is built on validated, quantified diagnostic findings rather than assumptions. When you can say "our FCR is 62% versus a top-quartile benchmark of 85%, costing $2.4M annually in excess truck rolls," the urgency is self-evident.

## Dimension 2: Influence Network

The <GlossaryTerm term="Influence Network">Influence Network</GlossaryTerm> maps the informal power structures that will accelerate or impede adoption. Three types of influencers matter:

1. **Champions** — Enthusiastic supporters who actively promote the change to their peers. They provide social proof that the change is worthwhile.
2. **Skeptics** — Thoughtful critics who raise legitimate concerns. Engaging skeptics early strengthens the change plan and converts potential resistors into informed advocates.
3. **Connectors** — People with broad social networks who amplify messages — positive or negative — across the organization. They may not have strong opinions about the change but their influence is disproportionate.

<Callout type="tip" title="Identify the Top 5 Informal Leaders">
In every organization, a small number of individuals have disproportionate informal influence. They are not necessarily managers — they may be senior technicians, veteran coordinators, or respected team leads. Identify the top 5 informal leaders in the affected population, engage them early, and invest time in earning their support. Their endorsement is worth more than any formal communication campaign.

<ReflectionPrompt
  question="Who are the top 3 informal leaders in your team or department? Are they likely to be Champions, Skeptics, or Connectors for an AI-driven change initiative?"
  answer="Identifying informal leaders is critical because their endorsement or resistance carries more weight than formal communications. Champions actively promote change, Skeptics raise legitimate concerns that strengthen your plan, and Connectors amplify messages (positive or negative) across the organization. Engaging all three types early is essential."

## Dimension 3: Communications

Assess the organization's communication infrastructure and culture. Can messages reach all affected stakeholders reliably? Are existing channels trusted? Is there a history of transparent communication, or has past communication been perceived as corporate spin?
