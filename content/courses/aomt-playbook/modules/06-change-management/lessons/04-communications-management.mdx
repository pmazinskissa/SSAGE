# Communications Management

Effective communications management ensures that the right people receive the right information at the right time through the right channels. Poor communication is the single most cited reason for change resistance, and it is entirely preventable with deliberate planning.

## The 5W Planning Framework

Structure every communication using the 5W framework:

- **Who** — Which stakeholder group is this communication for? Different groups need different messages.
- **What** — What specific information does this group need at this point in the change journey?
- **When** — What is the optimal timing? Too early creates anxiety; too late creates distrust.
- **Where** — Which channel will be most effective for this audience? Email, town hall, team meeting, digital signage, intranet?
- **Why** — What action or understanding should this communication produce? Every communication should have a measurable objective.

<Callout type="concept" title="Different Stakeholders Need Different Messages">
A single communication sent to everyone rarely works. Executives need strategic context and ROI projections. Middle managers need operational impact details and talking points for their teams. Frontline workers need practical information about what changes for them personally, when, and what support is available. Craft distinct messages for each audience, even when the underlying change is the same.

## 4-Phase Communication Cadence

<ProcessFlow steps={[
  { title: "Awareness (Pre-Launch)", description: "Introduce the change vision, share the case for change backed by diagnostic data, and signal that the organization is committed. Focus on 'why' and 'what' — not yet 'how.' Timeline: 4-6 weeks before go-live." },
  { title: "Understanding (Pre-Launch)", description: "Provide detailed information about what will change, when, and for whom. Address common questions and concerns. Begin training communications. Timeline: 2-4 weeks before go-live." },
  { title: "Engagement (Launch)", description: "Communicate go-live details, provide real-time support information, celebrate early adopters, and share initial success stories. Maintain high communication frequency. Timeline: Launch week plus 2 weeks." },
  { title: "Reinforcement (Post-Launch)", description: "Share performance data showing the impact of the change, recognize contributions, address emerging issues transparently, and maintain regular update cadence. Timeline: Ongoing, tapering from weekly to monthly." }

<Callout type="tip" title="Two-Way Communication">
The most effective change communication is two-way. Create mechanisms for employees to ask questions, share concerns, and provide feedback — and visibly respond to what they share. Town halls with live Q&A, anonymous question boxes, dedicated Slack channels, and manager-led team discussions all create two-way channels. When people feel heard, resistance decreases even when their concerns cannot be fully addressed.

## Measuring Communication Effectiveness

Track whether communications are reaching their audience and achieving their objectives:

| Metric | Method | Target |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Reach | Open rates, attendance counts | >80% of target audience |
| Comprehension | Pulse survey questions | >70% can articulate the change rationale |
| Sentiment | Feedback channel analysis | Net positive or improving trend |
| Action | Behavior change indicators | Aligned with change adoption milestones |
