## Module 1 — Overview

| # | App Location | Lesson File | PPT Slide | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Introducing AI Enabled Problem-Solving | `01-overview/lessons/04-introducing-aomt.mdx` | **Slide 5** | Add concept graphic introducing AI Enabled Problem-Solving. Paul noted "this or something better" is acceptable. | #42 / Comment #93 |
| 2 | Introducing AI Enabled Problem-Solving | `01-overview/lessons/04-introducing-aomt.mdx` | *No specific slide* | Add a graphic showing the benefits of the methodology. Paul: "We should have a graphic here — preferably one that shows the benefits." | Comment #77 |
| 3 | Playbook Structure | `01-overview/lessons/05-playbook-structure.mdx` | **Slide 6** | Replace current bullet-point list with Slide 6 visual. Both Deniz and Paul agreed the visual is cleaner and more effective. | #42 / Comment #102 |
| 4 | Core Activities (phase overview) | `01-overview/lessons/04-introducing-aomt.mdx` or phase intro | **Slide 10** | Replace linear/waterfall-looking process flow with the circular/iterative graphic from Slide 10. Fly-over pop-ups showing descriptions are a nice-to-have. | #42, #46 / Comments #112, #115, #116 |

| 7 | Issues Tree — Metro Cable example | `02-ai-problem-solving/lessons/04-issues-tree-and-hypotheses.mdx` | **Slide 15** | Add the Metro Cable issues tree example from Slide 15. The section references an issues tree but shows no visual example. | #42 / Comment |
| 8 | Issues Tree — AI artifact example | `02-ai-problem-solving/lessons/04-issues-tree-and-hypotheses.mdx` | *No specific slide* | Add a concrete example prompt used to generate Issues Tree branches via AI, plus a sample of the AI output. Practitioners need to know what format to expect. | #48 / Comment #183 |
| 9 | Data Request — Metro Cable initial list | `02-ai-problem-solving/lessons/05-data-request-and-ingestion.mdx` | **Slide 18** | Add Metro Cable initial data request example list. Current section lacks a concrete example. | #43 / Comment |

| 11 | Data Request — Refined example | `02-ai-problem-solving/lessons/05-data-request-and-ingestion.mdx` | *See V2 docx comment #191* | Add a "Refined Data Request" example showing how the Metro Cable request evolved after initial hypothesis testing. Visual referenced in V2 docx comment. | #47 / Comment #191 |
| 12 | Data Visualization — Visualization Types table | `02-ai-problem-solving/lessons/06-data-visualization.mdx` | *No specific slide* | Add small thumbnail representations or fly-over popup previews for each visualization type in the table, so learners can see what each one looks like. | #48 / Comment #203 |
| 13 | AI-Enabled Research — Geographic mapping example | `02-ai-problem-solving/lessons/10-ai-enabled-research.mdx` | *No specific slide* | Format AI prompt/response blocks to look like actual LLM output (styled response block) for realism. Include the output visualization alongside AI text for the geographic mapping example. | #48 / Comments #205, #237 |
